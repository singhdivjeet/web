				>Mushin Innovation Labs Pvt. Ltd.</a
			>
			where I delivered 6 major projects within a year of taking charge, as a
			Chief Software Architect & Director. A part of my role was working with
			the Business Development team to establish the company’s portfolio,
			expanding the business verticals. I was also an integral part of the
			hiring and building of the company’s software team. Additionally, I
			managed a cross-platform team comprising of 6 frontend, backend, and cloud
			engineers.

			As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and
			design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge with a keen eye for design
			to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build efficient and
			scalable applications while providing engaging and pixel-perfect user
			experiences.

			off another item on my bucket list.
